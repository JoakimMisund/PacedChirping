# Roadmap
There are two directories: master\_thesis and latest.


Directory master\_thesis contains code used for Joakims master thesis and the
paper "Paced Chirping: Rapid flow start with very low queuing delay" [Link coming]().


Directory latest contains the latest congestion control module implementation and
information about the kernel implementation and where it is located. This is probably where you want to go.
