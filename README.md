# Roadmap

This repository contains code related to the development and evaluation of Paced
Chirping. We have divided it into three directories, master\_thesis,
latest, and evaluation.


Directory master\_thesis contains code used for Joakims master thesis and the
paper "Paced Chirping: Rapid flow start with very low queuing delay" [Coming]().


Directory latest contains information about the most up to date implementation
based on the net-next branch. This is probably where you want to go.


Directory evaluation contains code used for evaluation.
