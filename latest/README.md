# Latest kernel
The latest kernel can be cloned from
[github.com/JoakimMisund/net-next](https://www.github.com/JoakimMisund/net-next).

That repository has two branches; master and paced\_chirping. master is a mirror
of net-next, and it is used to regularly rebase the Paced Chirping code.
paced\_chirping has the most up-to date implementation of the kernel-part of
Paced Chirping. It provides a chirping framework that any congestion control module can use.

# Latest DCTCP congestion control module
Coming very soon.
