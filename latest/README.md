# Latest kernel
The latest kernel can be cloned from
[github.com/JoakimMisund/net-next](https://www.github.com/JoakimMisund/net-next).
The root github page can currently not be displayed by using the link, but you can
jump straight to the code by using a direct url to any of the directories [github.com/JoakimMisund/net-next/tree/paced_chirping/net](https://www.github.com/JoakimMisund/net-next/tree/paced_chirping/net).

The repository has two branches; master and paced\_chirping. master is a mirror
of net-next and is used to regularly rebase the Paced Phirping code.
paced\_chirping has the most up-to date implementation of the kernel-part of
Paced Chirping.
